## 1. Data We Process

### A. Data You Enter (stored on your device)
Kids Shoe Sizer stores the following data locally on your device:
- Child profile details (for example: name, birthday, shoe sizes)
- Growth records (for example: dates, foot length, notes)
- App settings (theme, language, measurement unit, notifications, ad-removal status)

This local data is saved using on-device storage and is not sent to our own servers.

### B. Data Processed by Third-Party Services
The app uses third-party services that may process data independently:
- **Google AdMob** (ads)
- **Google Play Billing** (in-app purchase: remove ads)
- **Google Play Services / Android platform services** (app distribution, integrity, diagnostics)

These services may process technical/device data such as device identifiers, IP address, app interactions, purchase data, and diagnostics according to their own policies.

## 2. How Data Is Used

Data is used to:
- Provide shoe size conversion and growth tracking features
- Save your preferences and app state
- Show ads (unless ads are removed via purchase)
- Process and restore purchases
- Schedule local reminders (if you enable notifications)

## 3. Notifications and Permissions

The app may request these permissions:
- `POST_NOTIFICATIONS`: to send reminder notifications
- `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED`: to restore scheduled reminders after reboot
- `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM`: to schedule reminder timing
- `REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS`: optional, to improve reminder reliability
- `INTERNET`: required for ads, billing, and store-related services
- `com.android.vending.BILLING`: required for in-app purchases

You can deny or revoke permissions in your device settings.

## 4. Data Sharing

We do not sell your personal data.

We do not operate our own backend to collect your profile data. Data may still be processed by third-party SDKs/services listed above as part of ads, billing, or platform operations.

## 5. Data Retention

- Locally stored app data remains on your device until you delete it, clear app storage, or uninstall the app.
- Third-party providers retain data according to their own retention policies.

## 6. Children's Privacy

Kids Shoe Sizer is intended for parents/caregivers to manage shoe size information. The app does not require account creation and we do not knowingly collect children's personal data on our own servers.

## 7. Your Choices and Rights

Depending on your location, you may have rights regarding personal data processed by third parties (for example access, deletion, objection, or restriction rights). For requests related to third-party processing, please review and contact the relevant provider directly.

## 8. Security

We use reasonable measures available in the app and platform, but no method of electronic storage or transmission is 100% secure.
